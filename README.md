# ITProject-Management-Repo
This project is started in request to the City of Mequon seeking assistance in developing the IT strategic plan. 

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The City of Mequon, WI, is the largest city in Ozaukee County and the third largest city in land
area in the state of Wisconsin. The City of Mequon provides public and information services to
the citizens that enhance the quality of life in the community. The city has 4 primary facilities,
namely City Hall, Public Safety Building, East Side Fire Station, and Public Works Safety. These
facilities have various departments which include City Administrator's Office, City Clerk's Office,
Finance, Public Works, Community Development, Police Department, and Fire Department.
This project is started in request to the City of Mequon seeking assistance in developing the ICT
Infrastructure Plan. The proposed plan focuses on developing an Information Technology Plan
that guides the organization in planning, designing, implementing, and maintaining the present and
future technology requirements, so the city will have a more reliable, available, secure,
and improved usability in a cost-effective way over the next 3-4 years. As a result, citizens and
employees will be able to enjoy and use the system more effectively.
The budget for this project has been reduced from $110,000 to $88,000. An IT Security Consultant
has been added to enhance system security. The addition of the IT Security Consultant has brought
the project over budget and over schedule. The project WBS has been revised to make sure that
the project is back within the schedule and the revised budget. A quality management plan is being
proposed to ensure the quality of the project and the MOV is being achieved.

# MEASURABLE ORGANIZATIONAL VALUE (MOV):
The City of Mequon is striving to improve and maintain the current IT technologies used by the
city. The project will focus upon creating a cost-effective plan with the highest benefits. 
A costeffective plan will efficiently use the city resources to improve and maintain the existing IT
technologies during the next 4 years. Incremental changes to the buildings Wi-Fi routers and
network switches will upgrade the wireless and wired networks resulting in higher wireless
network speed and while also maintaining wired network stability. To ensure reliability, the
workstations and laptops will be incrementally replaced with newer and more powerful
workstations. All backup data will be relocated from the backup servers to the cloud to ensure that
it is always available, free of viruses, threats, and more secure (AWS guarantees 100% security).
Relocating the backup data to the cloud is also a very cost-effective move. A software security
company will be added to improve on-premises systems security. The servers will be replaced to
ensure highly operational servers with continued reliability. All current software licenses will be
renewed. The purpose of these cost-effective upgrades is to provide a highly beneficial system so
that the city can continue to provide cost-effective services to the citizens of Mequon.

# DESIRED VALUE OF IMPACT:
The planned IT system changes will decrease the number of IT help desk complaints because the
upgraded and improved systems will be easier to use and more stable. The upgraded system will
be more secure, which will reduce security threats and improve reliability. The project team
anticipates an improved IT system will increase user satisfaction, which means more citizens will
utilize online resources. The success of the plan will be validated by annual surveys of citizens and
city employees verifying satisfaction with the IT system changes.

# QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN
# OBJECTIVE:
The GradBird Consulting project team will strive to complete the project within budget and on
